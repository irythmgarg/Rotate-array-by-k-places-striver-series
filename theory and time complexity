Theory
Problem Statement:
Rotate a given array nums of size n to the right by k steps.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3
Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Approach:

The problem can be solved using the reverse approach:
Reverse the entire array.
Reverse the first k elements.
Reverse the remaining 𝑛−𝑘
n−k elements.
This rearrangement achieves the desired rotation efficiently.
Key Insight:

Rotating an array 𝑘
k steps to the right is equivalent to moving the last 𝑘
k elements to the front while maintaining their order.
Complexity:

Time Complexity: 
𝑂(𝑛)
O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the size of the array, as reversing the array takes linear time.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂(1)
O(1), since the rotation is performed in-place without extra memory.
Edge Cases:𝑘=0
k=0: No rotation; the array remains unchanged.
𝑘≥𝑛
k≥n: Rotation repeats after 
n steps, so use 𝑘%𝑛
k%n to avoid unnecessary operations.
Single-element or empty arrays: The array remains unchanged.



Below is the detailed explanation and commented version of the provided code to rotate an array to the right by 
𝑘
k steps, along with its theory and algorithm.

class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size(); // Get the size of the array
        
        // Handle cases where k >= n by reducing k to k % n
        k = k % n;

        // Step 1: Reverse the entire array
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // Step 2: Reverse the first k elements
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);

        // Step 3: Reverse the remaining n - k elements
        reverse(nums.begin() + k, nums.end());

};
Algorithm Explanation
Input:

Accept a reference to a vector nums and an integer 
𝑘
k, the number of steps to rotate.
Initialization:

Calculate 
𝑘
%
𝑛
k%n to handle cases where 𝑘≥𝑛
k≥n, as rotating 
n times brings the array back to its original state.
Reverse Approach:

Step 1: Reverse the entire array.
This makes the last 
𝑘
k elements move to the front but in reverse order.
Step 2: Reverse the first 
𝑘
k elements.
This restores their original order in the rotated position.
Step 3: Reverse the remaining 

n−k elements.
This restores the order of the rest of the array.
In-Place Rotation:

The operation is performed in-place using the reverse function, which swaps elements in a subrange.
Key Points
The algorithm leverages the properties of array reversal to achieve rotation efficiently.
The reverse function is part of the C++ STL and operates in 
O(n) time.
Edge Cases Handled 𝑘=0
k=0: No rotation needed; the array remains unchanged.𝑘≥𝑛
k≥n: 
k is reduced to 𝑘%𝑛
k%n, as rotating n times or multiples of n does not change the array.
Empty or Single-Element Array: Rotation does not affect the array.
